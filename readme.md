## Introduction

_Whack-a-mole_ is a basic version of the fairground amusement I build for my infant children to enjoy. As well as coding this offline-first PWA, I hand drew all the game sprites, recorded my own audio and even created my own font.

This project was a good opportunity for me to re-visit using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
